"Proof is in the progress" - Drake

</Alert>

This document details Sentry's work in integrating and supporting [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), the open standard for metrics, traces and logs. In particular, it focuses on the integration between [Sentry's performance monitoring product](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/) and [OpenTelemetry's tracing spec](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/).

## Background

When Sentry performance monitoring was initially introduced, OpenTelemetry was in early stages. This lead to us adopt a slightly different model from OpenTelemetry, notably we have this concept of transactions that OpenTelemetry does not have. We've described this, and some more historical background, in our <Link to="/sdk/research/performance/">performance monitoring research document</Link>.

TODO: Add history about OpenTelemetry Sentry Exporter: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/sentryexporter

## Approach

TODO: Talk about the approach we are using, based on Matt's hackweek project - https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1876

## OpenTelemetry Context

TODO: Do we add OpenTelemetry Event Context?

## Transaction Protocol

TODO: Talk about generating transactions

import "./span-protocol.mdx"

- TODO: Talk about generating stuff (breadcrumbs/error events) from Span Events: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/48ee3288c030ed32374125190a8abf7ced1a4238/exporter/sentryexporter/sentry_exporter.go#L167-L202

### Semantic Conventions

Using the [Span.Name](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/724e427879e3d2bae2edc0218fff06e37b9eb46e/opentelemetry/proto/trace/v1/trace.proto#L110-L121), [Span.Attributes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/724e427879e3d2bae2edc0218fff06e37b9eb46e/opentelemetry/proto/trace/v1/trace.proto#L174-L186), and [Span.Kind](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/724e427879e3d2bae2edc0218fff06e37b9eb46e/opentelemetry/proto/trace/v1/trace.proto#L153-L156) of OpenTelemetry Spans, we can generate ops, descriptions, and tags. This exact mapping is described below.
