"Proof is in the progress" - Drake

</Alert>

This document details Sentry's work in integrating and supporting [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), the open standard for metrics, traces and logs. In particular, it focuses on the integration between [Sentry's performance monitoring product](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/) and [OpenTelemetry's tracing spec](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/).

## Background

When Sentry performance monitoring was initially introduced, OpenTelemetry was in early stages. This lead to us adopt a slightly different model from OpenTelemetry, notably we have this concept of transactions that OpenTelemetry does not have. We've described this, and some more historical background, in our <Link to="/sdk/research/performance/">performance monitoring research document</Link>.

## Approach

TODO: Talk about the approach we are using, based on Matt's hackweek project - https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1876

## OpenTelemetry Context

TODO: Do we add OpenTelemetry Event Context?

## Transaction Protocol
